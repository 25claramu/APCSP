	<p> This year was very interesting academics wise. I had to take some difficult classes, like chem and math, so getting used to the workload and subject matter was difficult at first. Even though they were quite challenging, math and chemistry ended up being some of my favorite classes this year and in my entire high school experience. Math was particularly fun because of the class environment. We got a lot done but it was still silly. Chemistry was fun because I really liked the subject. I think that I would like to pursue more chemistry. History was also a fun class because I really enjoyed the topics we learned about and the class discussions. I also think that history really helped me improve my writing skills. As usual, English was terrible. Overall I liked my sophomore year classes. .</p>
