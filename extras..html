	<p> Debate has been a part of my life for 3 years now. This past year I was able to improve my debate skills greatly. I learned how to read and respond to kritiks and this overall helped me to better understand the world around me. I had a lot of wins and losses in debate this year but it was all fun and educational. I also became president of the debate team this year! I am really excited about this position and I'm excited to improve the team.</p>

           <p>For better or worse, Robotics became a major part of my life this past year. I joined on a whim and became Publicity lead, I did not know then what would become of it. Being an operations lead meant that I needed to work with other operations leads and mentors. I did not realize the amount of parents that I would be working with, I also did not realize that they would be crazy. Robotics hijacked my life, I was checking slack constantly and always stressed about a deadline or missing a message. I had to manage conflicting adults and crazy kids, it was not enjoyable. I didn’t even learn how to build a robot. No matter my experience, our team did qualify for and attend the Worlds Competition in Houston, along with other qualifiers in Monterey and Fresno. Those were slightly enjoyable. I will not be continuing with robotics next year, because it’s insane, but I was able to build many friendships on the team.</p>
